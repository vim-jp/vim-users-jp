Many of them have more than 50 variations within a single factor. It's rare that any of the factors are confirmed by Google, but in the past year they have confirmed the top 3 ranking factors. Last year Google confirmed RankBrain was the third most important ranking factor, but Google refused to say what the first two were. That is until earlier this year when Andrey Lipattsev, a Search Quality Senior Strategist at Google, said the other two factors were links and content. JR Oakes and Patrick Stox will break down some of the things that Google may be looking for with regards to content, links, and RankBrain and tell you what you really need to know about each.</p>

<p><b>May 2016: <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seos-dont-need-replacement-google-pagerank/163178/">Google PageRank as Part of One Big SEO Picture</a></b></p>

<p>Consider PageRank only one part of the bigger picture and start looking at other signals. If you are going to do a comparison using existing metrics, then compare apples to apples. Use the metrics as a guide but not an absolute truth. Use them to inform, but not make, your decisions.</p>

<p>HTTP/2 is a much needed refresh of the HTTP protocol that was based largely on Google’s own SPDY protocol. The protocol brings with it vast improvements in communication between browsers and servers, reducing load times.</p>

<b><p>February 2016: <a href="http://searchengineland.com/everything-not-blog-post-start-using-silos-242508">Everything Should Not Be A Blog Post: Start Using Silos</a></p></b>

<p>Are you ready for the Mobile Apocalypse or Mobilegeddon? If your website is not mobile-friendly, the impending Google algorithm update on April 21st might hit you hard! This is a serious update, and Google is serious about it.</p>

<b><p>January 2015: <a href="http://www.theedesign.com/blog/what-is-google-penguin-algorithm">What is the Google Penguin Algorithm?</a></p></b>

<p>Google Penguin is the algorithm that Google made to target link spam. It was announced on April 24, 2012 and targets link schemes, automation tactics, and poor quality link building. Basically, anything meant to game the rankings of a site through links. Penguin is meant to catch tactics such as blog comment spam, directory spam, article spam, buying links, link networks, and many other methods that were used to quickly rank a website with low quality links or practices that violate Google Webmaster Guidelines.</p>

<b><p>January 2015: <a href="http://www.theedesign.com/blog/2015/blocking-spam-referral-traffic-google-analytics">Blocking Spam Referral Traffic from Google Analytics</a></p></b>

<p>There is no one perfect method to get rid of the spam at this time. Because of the variety of different types of spam and the different methods being used, you may need a few different methods implemented and even then some spam is likely to get through. At least a hostname filter to take care of ghost referral spam coming through the Google Measurement Protocol and an exclude filter for crawler bot traffic. If you need to see your historical data with the spam filtered out, you can create a custom segment in Google Analytics.</p>

<b><p>December 2014: <a href="http://www.theedesign.com/blog/2014/leveraging-google-adwords-convert-holiday-shoppers">Leveraging Google Adwords to Convert Holiday Shoppers</a></p></b>

<p>With the holidays approaching, businesses are wondering how they can attract more shoppers. Shopping never sleeps: According to Google Inside AdWords, one third of all shopping searches on Google happen between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. How can businesses use Adwords to their advantage during the holidays?</p>

<b><p>October 2014: <a href="http://www.theedesign.com/blog/2014/managing-a-companys-online-reputation">Managing a Company’s Online Reputation</a></p></b>

<p>Most business owners fail to be proactive in managing their online reputation. It is only after disaster strikes and bad reviews or comments are affecting their revenue, that they are suddenly interested. Reputation management is not just for companies, but for people as well, and can be used to bury everything from drunken photos to medical information or even mugshots and arrest records.</p>

<b><p>August 2014: <a href="http://www.theedesign.com/blog/2014/what-can-marketing-automation-do-for-you">What Can Marketing Automation Do For You?</a></p></b>

<p>As marketers, we have access to a lot of information about website visitors and have the ability to get even more information about their behavior. The question is what do we do with all that data? The ultimate goal of marketing automation is to use that data to target the right user with the right message at the right time.</p>

<b><p>April 2014: <a href="http://www.theedesign.com/blog/2014/seo-audit-design-doesnt-bring-you-traffic">SEO Audit: Why Design Doesn’t Bring You Traffic</a></p></b>

<p>Over the years I have seen many great looking websites, even brand new websites that look great but end up costing the owner money because they don’t bring the traffic or don’t convert. A lot of times it’s the same problems creeping up because of the CMS (Content Management System) chosen, that the designers and developers either don’t have time to look for in the scope of the project or don’t know to look for. Rarely is the expert in SEO and CRO the same person designing and developing a website, so the people trying to make your site look beautiful and the ones who would be driving business to your website are often different people.</p>
